Black Swan Indicators Comparison

This notebook compares some of the existing Black Swan detectors in market crashes. As of writing today, these models include:

1. Z-score based on daily returns (from stats library)
3. Percentile-based threshold (similar idea to z-score)
3. Price deviation over moving average standard deviation

It is welcomed to download and play around with the settings and threshold to explore for insights. The shown grpahs here are during the Financial Crisis of 2008.
Comparing different detected Black Swan periods might help decision making in the qunatitative world, especially during unexpected market trends.

Please feel free to suggest any Black Swan model that is not included. I will try and update it asap.
